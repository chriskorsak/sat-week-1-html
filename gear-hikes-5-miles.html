    <h1>Gear for Hikes under 5 miles</h1>
    <p>You've seen him on the trail. It's hiker guy. He looks like a walking REI catalog. He's checking his GPS waypoints every two feet while taking a sip from his camelback and putting on his 4.56oz puffy coat at the hint of a breeze. It's soooo light! It also cost $300 dollars and will rip if you graze a blackberry bush, bro!</p>
    <p>Oh ya, I was supposed to provide gear tips. Here are what I think is a great list of gear you should consider bringing on a hike that's less than 5 miles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Sunscreen</li>
      <li>Map (preferably of the location you are hiking in)</li>
      <li>
        Snacks
        <a href="food-hiking.html">More food tips here!</a>
      </li>
      <li>Space Blanket</li>
      <li>Sunscreen</li>
      <li>A hiking partner (never hike alone, bro)</li>
    </ul>
