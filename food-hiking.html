    <h1>Snacks and food for hiking</h1>
    <p>I know everyone has a special diet these days, so consider this just a possible list of food you can bring on a hike. Feel free to substitute your own special foods and drinks if you have a favorite!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Protien Bar (Buy the natural ones!)</li>
      <li>Apple</li>
      <li>Almonds</li>
      <li>Trail Mix (mix up your own for extra points)</li>
      <li>Beef Jerky</li>
      <li>Chocolate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why do we eat foods on the trail that we never <em>eat</em> at home? Why do we eat beef jerky when hiking, but never while sitting at our office desk? Oh wait, you do eat beef jerky at the office? You nasty.</p>
