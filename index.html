    <h1>Hiking Tips Website</h1>
    <p>This site is dedicated to providing basic hiking tips to help you get the most out of your local trail. I am based in Portland, Oregon, so many of my experiences and viewpoints will be a bit biased from a pacific northwest perspective. Nonetheless, I feel like no matter where you are in the country or world, you'll be able to learn something new!</p>
